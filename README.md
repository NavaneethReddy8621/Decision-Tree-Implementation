*DESCRIPTION* :  

For this project, I implemented a Decision Tree model to predict wine quality using the popular Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various physicochemical properties of wine, such as acidity, sugar content, chlorides, sulfur dioxide levels, and alcohol percentage, along with a quality score ranging from 0 to 10, which is assigned by wine tasters. My goal was to classify the quality of wine samples based on these chemical attributes. I began by exploring the data, checking for missing values, understanding the distribution of the features, and identifying any imbalances in the target variable. To simplify the classification task, I grouped the wine quality scores into broader categories (for example, low, medium, and high quality). This made the classification more practical and meaningful, especially since most of the data centered around mid-range scores.

Once the data was cleaned and prepared, I proceeded to build a Decision Tree classifier using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library. I split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively. After training the initial model, I used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to assess its performance. I also tuned the model by adjusting hyperparameters like max_depth, min_samples_split, and the splitting criterion (gini vs. entropy) to avoid overfitting and improve generalization. In addition, I visualized the decision tree structure, which helped me understand how the model made its predictions and which features it prioritized.

One of the key takeaways from this project was identifying the most important factors that influence wine quality. Features like alcohol content, sulphates, and volatile acidity emerged as the top contributors to predicting quality. This insight not only confirmed some domain knowledge from the wine industry but also showcased the interpretability of decision trees, which is one of their biggest advantages. Overall, this project was a great way to apply machine learning concepts in a real-world scenario, and it reinforced the importance of good data preprocessing, thoughtful feature engineering, and model tuning. It also highlighted the balance between model simplicity and performance, especially when working with interpretable models like decision trees.
